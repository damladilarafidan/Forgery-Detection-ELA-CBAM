# Forgery Detection in Digital Images using ELA and Attention-based CNN Architecture

This repository provides the official implementation of the paper:

**Forgery Detection in Digital Images using ELA and Attention-based CNN Architecture**  
*(Damla Dilara Fidan, G√ºl Tahaoglu, 2025)*

## üìñ Overview
This work proposes a forgery detection framework that combines **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** preprocessing with a **CNN enhanced by Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)**.  
The method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets: **CASIA v1.0, CASIA v2.0, and CoMoFoD**.  
Our results demonstrate that incorporating ELA preprocessing and CBAM improves the detection of tampered images compared to baseline CNN and existing attention-based approaches.
